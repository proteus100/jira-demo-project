## Interview Talking Point

> "I created this swimlane diagram in Excalidraw to visualize the PR-to-Jira workflow. I chose Excalidraw because its hand-drawn, low-fidelity style is perfect for early-stage wireframing and stakeholder collaboration. The diagram shows three actors—Developer, GitHub Actions automation, and Jira—and how they interact in the automated workflow."

**This sounds very professional!**
