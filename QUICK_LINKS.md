> "I created this portfolio to demonstrate my UX and business analysis capabilities. The visual workflow diagrams show my wireframing skills using Mermaid, a diagram-as-code tool. The user journey maps demonstrate my ability to understand user needs across different personas. And the working Jira integration proves I can bridge business requirements with technical implementation."
