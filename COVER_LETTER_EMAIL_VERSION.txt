Subject: Application for UX/BA Role - David Patheyjohns

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the UX/BA role at EmmersonWills. Your mission to be "The ISO Simplification Experts" resonates strongly with me—I believe complex compliance processes should feel effortless, not burdensome, and I've built my recent work around that exact principle.

WHY I'M A STRONG FIT FOR EMMERSONWILLS

I simplify complex processes. In my recent project automating GitHub-Jira integration, I tackled a challenge similar to what your clients face with ISO compliance: maintaining complete traceability while eliminating manual documentation burden. The result? I reduced a 7-step manual process to 1 automated step, achieving 95% time savings while improving accuracy to 100%—exactly the kind of simplification EmmersonWills delivers for ISO standards.

I understand compliance and traceability. ISO certification requires documented evidence, audit trails, and process visibility—requirements I've addressed in my technical work. My GitHub project demonstrates:
• Complete requirement-to-implementation traceability (like ISO audit trails)
• Automated record-keeping with zero errors (like ISO documentation requirements)
• Multi-stakeholder visibility (like ISO's need for different views per role)
• Process improvement with measurable ROI (70% reduction in context switching)

I bring UX/BA skills with technical depth. My portfolio includes:
• User journey mapping for 3 distinct personas (developers, managers, product owners)
• Workflow design with before/after process analysis showing clear business impact
• Requirements documentation including user stories, acceptance criteria, and traceability matrices
• Visual wireframing using modern diagram-as-code tools for process mapping
• Stakeholder communication tailored for business, technical, and quality audiences

This combination is valuable for a growing consultancy: I can design user-friendly client interfaces while understanding the technical constraints of system integration—essential when your software needs to connect with client ERPs, quality systems, and audit tools.

WHAT I'LL BRING TO YOUR TEAM

Process improvement mindset: I don't just document existing processes—I identify inefficiencies and design solutions. My project reduced manual effort by 95%, and I'd apply that same analytical approach to helping your clients simplify ISO compliance.

Empathy for non-technical users: ISO standards are written for auditors, not everyday users. I understand the challenge of translating dense requirements into simple, actionable workflows.

Multi-persona thinking: ISO software serves diverse users—consultants, client employees, quality managers, auditors. My user journey mapping demonstrates ability to understand different pain points and design for multiple user types simultaneously.

Small team agility: With 2-10 employees, you need someone who can wear multiple hats. My background spans UX design, business analysis, technical documentation, and systems thinking.

DEMONSTRATED SKILLS

I've created a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating my UX/BA capabilities:

GitHub Portfolio: https://github.com/proteus100/jira-demo-project

Includes:
• Visual workflow diagrams (6 types: swimlane, sequence, state, before/after, decision flow)
• User journey maps with quantified pain points and solutions
• Requirements documentation with acceptance criteria and traceability
• Working integration demonstrating the concept in practice

I'd be happy to walk you through this portfolio in an interview, showing how the same thinking applies to ISO compliance software.

WHY EMMERSONWILLS?

I'm drawn to your focus on simplification in the ISO space. Having worked with compliance requirements, I know how overwhelming they can be for businesses—especially SMEs who lack dedicated quality teams. The opportunity to make ISO certification feel manageable rather than burdensome is genuinely exciting.

Your Devon location is also ideal—I'm based in Stoke Canon, Exeter, and would love to work with a local consultancy serving UK businesses.

I believe my combination of UX/BA skills, technical understanding, and passion for process simplification makes me well-suited to help EmmersonWills continue wowing your growing client base. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your mission of ISO simplification.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you.

Kind regards,

David Patheyjohns
